# ThoughtsSaver

Dear Stranger, while this project is mainly used as an experimental platform for testing features, approaches, and solutions from JS, React, React Native, and Redux world,
its current structure is very close to the structure(exact tools may differ, e.g [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) instead of [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)) which I am trying to follow in the 'production-ready' projects, where I contribute if it is possible and reasonable enough.

I am planning to write a more detailed README file in the weekends. For now, please, see, [package.json](https://github.com/marian13/ThoughtsSaver/blob/master/package.json#L2) for a list of available commands and refer to the Expo official docs for the installation guides:
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/),
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/),
- [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
